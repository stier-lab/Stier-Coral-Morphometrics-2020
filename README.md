# Stier-Coral-Morphometrics-2020
Coral Morphometrics using Metashape

This project compares traditional field measurements of *Pocillopora* coral heads with 3D models constructed from digital images of the same coral using Agisoft Metashape software. We are interested in (1) creating a workflow utilizing best practices for photo acquistion and photogrammetry models of individual corals (2) compare information gained or lost from photogrammetry vs. in-field manual measurements and (3) the ecological relevance as a predictor for invertebrate communities within the coral. Data was collected in Moorea, French Polynesia on August 2019 for a project funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF).

# Python Code for Batch Analysis in Metashape

Matthew Gottleib, a UCSB alumni, developed Python code for the Ocean Recoveries lab that can facilitate photogrammetry processing of multiple files by enabling Alignment and 3D model creation of batches of files without user input. Those files are stored and maintained on Matthew's GitHub: https://github.com/Mgla96/OceanRecoveryLabScripts
