Coral Morphometrics using metashape


3D mesh reconstructions of *Pocillopora* coral colonies were developed from digital images using Agisoft Metashape software. Coral volume was calculated using software model estimation and from manual elipsoid volume approximation to (1) determine how the proportion overestimation of elipsoid volume increased or decreased with *wide* or *tight* branching corals and (2) fit general linear models using the invertebrate data we collected to both elipsoid and software estimated volume predictor variables to determine if software volume provided a better fit to the data.
